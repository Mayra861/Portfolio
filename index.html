        <em><h4>Leadership experience:</h4></em>
        Through an entrepreneurship program called BUILD, I learned to facilitate discussions amongst my team and guide them in a productive manner. Some skills I learned are communication and problem solving. These skills have helped me by making sure I always state my feelings and needs in any environment I am in, and always assuming positive intention from others. I know how to take in consideration other people's needs and treat them the way they want to be treated. I understand that in order for a team to be successful you must create a positive and safe environment for everyone.
